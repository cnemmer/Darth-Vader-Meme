Conceptually this game was absolute garbage. A total disgrace to the Lucas name and Darth Vader Legacy. I hope you rot in hell for making this- RandomTroll

Such a fun game! My kids find hours of entertainment playing this! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!- KansasGurl88

Vader Games finally meets sheer perfection in The Darth Side! I sabered every moment!- AnakinMan

This is way better than getting dysentery on the Oregon Trail games.-WagonMan
